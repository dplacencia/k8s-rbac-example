Thank you for installing {{ .Chart.Name }}.

Your release is named {{ .Release.Name }}.

This Helm chart has configured the following:
- Namespaces: staging and production
- RBAC Roles and RoleBindings for developer and admin in both namespaces
- Secrets for RDS credentials specific to each environment

Verification and Testing
========================

To ensure the deployment is working as expected, follow these steps:

1. Check Namespace Creation
---------------------------
Verify that the namespaces have been created:

    kubectl get namespaces

You should see both staging and production listed.

2. Verify RBAC Role and RoleBinding Configuration
-------------------------------------------------
Check that the RBAC roles and bindings are applied in each namespace:

    kubectl get roles -n staging
    kubectl get rolebindings -n staging
    kubectl get roles -n production
    kubectl get rolebindings -n production

This should show roles and bindings for both developer and admin.

3. Verify RDS Credentials (Secrets)
-----------------------------------
Ensure that secrets for RDS credentials are stored in each namespace:

    kubectl get secrets -n staging
    kubectl get secrets -n production

You should see staging-rds-credentials in staging and production-rds-credentials in production.

4. Run End-to-End Tests
-----------------------
An external test script (test_config.sh) has been provided to perform end-to-end testing of the RBAC and secrets configuration.
This script will check if the correct permissions are enforced for each role and namespace.

To run the test:
  1. Ensure kubectl is configured and you have access to the cluster.
  2. Execute the script:

    ./test_config.sh

The test script will validate:
  - developer has full access to staging but no access to production.
  - admin has full access to both staging and production.

Expected Test Output
--------------------
The test_config.sh script should provide output indicating:
  - Success if permissions and secrets are correctly configured.
  - Error messages if any permissions are misconfigured or access is incorrectly granted/denied.

Troubleshooting
---------------
If the tests fail:
  - Ensure the Helm chart was deployed successfully.
  - Check Kubernetes logs for any unexpected issues.
  - Verify that Kubernetes contexts and permissions are set up correctly.

Additional Notes
----------------
- Production Best Practices: Remember to rotate secrets periodically and avoid hardcoding sensitive values in the values file.
- RBAC Security: Follow the principle of least privilege when customizing roles and bindings.

Thank you for using the chart! Reach out if you encounter any issues or need further customization.
